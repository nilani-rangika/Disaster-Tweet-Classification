# Disaster-Tweet-Classification

With the proliferation of internet-based communication technologies, people are increasingly using social media during disasters. Hence, disaster tweet classification plays a significant role to support situation awareness and disaster response broadly. Therefore, this project aims at classifying disaster tweets in to two categories, namely, Related and Not-Related.
